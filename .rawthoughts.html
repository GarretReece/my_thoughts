Set up a few not-giant-tech-company based social accounts in the last twenty four hours (cohost, mastodon, and storygraph) in an effort to stop giving attention and data to companies that are actively bad. We'll see how well they work and how well it sticks. <br>

I'll miss Twitter and the artists and poets and authors and friends that I followed, but it's just not morally acceptable to me any more. Getting my twice a year urge to get rid of my smartphone entirely.

Spent a ludicrous amount of money for a sculpture just now and both wincing at the cost and delighted that I did it. I think this is going to be the summer of actually following through on a couple of very big plans, and this feels like the first.
